# NewOverflow-1

## Description
Lets try moving to 64-bit, but don't worry we'll start easy. Overflow the buffer and change the return address to the flag function in this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/787377de1afc245da664a898cd3d0780/vuln). You can find it in /problems/newoverflow-1_1_39d472170ee5080cac1226374a7101a7 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/787377de1afc245da664a898cd3d0780/vuln.c).

## Hints
Now that we're in 64-bit, what used to be 4 bytes, now may be 8 bytes

## Solution
Write 64 bytes to fill buffer + 8 bytes to overwrite rbp + the flag() address.

This works, but fopen() in the flag() fails to open flag.txt.
